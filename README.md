# SlicerDMRICheck
this is a check for my pull request in SlicerDMRI

Hello, this is my first time to pull quest on github, if you have any questions please let me know.

The bug code I encountered during the development process involved many different third-party libraries. In order not to affect the original project, I built a new repository, which contains the third-party libraries used in the test project.

The debug version of the test project is configured in the cmakelists file. In this repository, the AfterModify branch saves the modified version and the file after build, while the BeforeModify branch saves the original code before modification and the file after build.
